# Release Process

This document describes the release process for RpcNet using conventional commits and automated tooling.

## Overview

RpcNet uses a semi-automated release process that:
- âœ… Generates changelogs automatically from conventional commit messages
- âœ… Bumps versions consistently across all files
- âœ… Creates release branches following a standard naming convention
- âœ… Validates releases through automated PR checks
- âœ… Ensures reproducible and documented releases

The process is designed to be simple, requiring just a single command to prepare a release.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

The release tooling uses `git-cliff` for changelog generation. The Makefile will automatically install it if missing, so no manual installation is required.

If you want to install it manually:

```bash
cargo install git-cliff
```

### Repository Requirements

- Clean working directory (uncommitted changes can be stashed)
- Access to push to the repository
- Familiarity with conventional commit format (see below)

### Understanding the Release Files

The following files control the release process:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Makefile` | Main entry point - use `make release-prepare` |
| `cliff.toml` | Configures git-cliff for changelog generation |
| `scripts/prepare-release.sh` | Automation script (called by Makefile) |
| `.github/workflows/release-pr.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow for PR validation |
| `docs/RELEASING.md` | This document - release process guide |

## Quick Start

For the impatient, here's the complete release workflow:

```bash
# 1. Prepare release
make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0

# 2. Push and create PR
git push -u origin release/0.2.0

# 3. After PR is reviewed and merged
git checkout main && git pull
git tag -a 0.2.0 -m "Release 0.2.0"
git push origin 0.2.0

# 4. Publish (if not automatic)
make publish
```

## Detailed Release Process

### 1. Prepare Release

Use the Makefile to prepare a release:

```bash
make release-prepare VERSION=<new-version>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Patch release (bug fixes only)
make release-prepare VERSION=0.1.1

# Minor release (new features, backwards compatible)
make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0

# Major release (breaking changes)
make release-prepare VERSION=1.0.0

# Pre-release versions
make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0-beta.1
make release-prepare VERSION=1.0.0-rc.1
```

**What this does:**

1. âœ… Validates version format (semver)
2. âœ… Installs `git-cliff` if not already installed
3. âœ… Creates release branch: `release/<version>`
4. âœ… Generates/updates `CHANGELOG.md` from conventional commits
5. âœ… Updates version in `Cargo.toml`
6. âœ… Updates version references in `README.md`
7. âœ… Updates `Cargo.lock`
8. âœ… Creates a single commit with all changes

**Example:**

```bash
make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0
```

**Output:**

```
Preparing release 0.2.0...
Current version: 0.1.0
Preparing release 0.2.0
Creating release branch: release/0.2.0
Generating changelog...
Updating version in Cargo.toml...
Updating version in README.md...
Updating Cargo.lock...
Committing changes...

âœ… Release preparation complete!

Next steps:
  1. Review the changes: git show
  2. Push the branch: git push -u origin release/0.2.0
  3. Create a PR on GitHub
  4. After PR is merged, tag the release: git tag 0.2.0 && git push origin 0.2.0
```

### 2. Review Changes

Before pushing, review what was changed:

```bash
# Review the commit
git show

# Review the generated changelog
cat CHANGELOG.md
```

### 3. Push and Create PR

Push the release branch:

```bash
git push -u origin release/<version>
```

**Example:**
```bash
git push -u origin release/0.2.0
```

GitHub will automatically prompt you to create a Pull Request. Alternatively:
1. Go to https://github.com/jsam/rpcnet/compare
2. Select your `release/<version>` branch
3. Create the pull request targeting `main`

**Automated PR Checks:**

The `.github/workflows/release-pr.yml` workflow will automatically:

- âœ… Validate version consistency across files
- âœ… Check that CHANGELOG.md exists and contains the new version
- âœ… Verify conventional commit format
- âœ… Run full test suite
- âœ… Post helpful comment with:
  - Release checklist
  - Post-merge instructions
  - Manual release commands

**Example PR Comment:**

```markdown
## ðŸš€ Release PR for 0.2.0

This PR prepares the release for version **0.2.0**.

### Checklist
- âœ… Version updated in `Cargo.toml`
- âœ… `CHANGELOG.md` generated
- âœ… All tests passing

### After Merge
Once this PR is merged to main:
1. Create and push the git tag: `git tag 0.2.0 && git push origin 0.2.0`
2. The release workflow will automatically publish to crates.io
3. GitHub release will be created automatically
```

### 4. Review and Merge

**Review Checklist:**

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md accurately reflects changes
- [ ] Version number is correct in all files
- [ ] All CI checks pass (format, lint, tests, coverage)
- [ ] No unexpected files were modified
- [ ] Commit message follows format

**Approval and Merge:**

Once approved by maintainers, merge the PR to `main` using:
- "Squash and merge" (recommended) - creates clean history
- "Merge commit" - preserves all commits

### 5. Tag the Release

**After the PR is merged**, create and push the version tag:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a <version> -m "Release <version>"
git push origin <version>
```

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a 0.2.0 -m "Release 0.2.0"
git push origin 0.2.0
```

### 6. Publish

Publish to crates.io using the Makefile:

```bash
make publish
```

This will:
- Run all pre-publication checks (tests, linting, docs)
- Package the crate
- Publish to crates.io with confirmation

**Or use individual commands:**

```bash
# Check everything is ready
make publish-check

# Dry run to verify package
make publish-dry-run

# Publish
make publish
```

### 7. Verify

After publishing, verify the release:

```bash
# Check crates.io
open https://crates.io/crates/rpcnet

# Test installation
cargo install rpcnet --version 0.2.0
```

## Conventional Commit Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic changelog generation:

### Commit Types

- `feat:` - New feature (shows in "Features" section)
- `fix:` - Bug fix (shows in "Bug Fixes" section)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `ci:` - CI/CD changes

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat: add connection pooling support"
git commit -m "feat(cluster): implement health checking"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve race condition in client reconnect"
git commit -m "fix(server): handle graceful shutdown properly"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat!: redesign cluster API for better ergonomics

BREAKING CHANGE: ClusterClient now requires explicit configuration"

# With scope and body
git commit -m "perf(codec): optimize serialization path

Reduces allocations by 40% in hot path by reusing buffers."
```

### Commit Scopes (optional)

Common scopes:
- `cluster` - Cluster management
- `client` - RPC client
- `server` - RPC server
- `codec` - Serialization/deserialization
- `tls` - TLS/security
- `docs` - Documentation
- `tests` - Testing infrastructure

## Versioning Strategy

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.2.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** (0.1.1): Bug fixes, backwards compatible

### Pre-releases

Use pre-release versions for beta/alpha releases:

- `0.2.0-beta.1` - Beta release
- `0.2.0-alpha.1` - Alpha release
- `0.2.0-rc.1` - Release candidate

## Advanced Usage

### Generate Changelog Only

Generate changelog without creating a release:

```bash
# Generate for all changes
make changelog

# Generate for specific version
make changelog VERSION=0.2.0
```

## Common Workflows

### Hotfix Release (Patch Version)

For urgent bug fixes:

```bash
# 1. Prepare hotfix release
make release-prepare VERSION=0.1.1

# 2. Push and create PR
git push -u origin release/0.1.1

# 3. Fast-track review and merge

# 4. Tag immediately
git checkout main && git pull
git tag -a 0.1.1 -m "Hotfix: critical bug fixes"
git push origin 0.1.1
```

### Beta/RC Releases

For pre-releases before a major version:

```bash
# Beta release
make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0-beta.1

# Release candidate
make release-prepare VERSION=1.0.0-rc.1

# Follow standard process, then:
cargo publish  # Pre-releases won't affect stable users
```

### Yanking a Release

If you need to yank a published release:

```bash
# Yank from crates.io (prevents new usage)
cargo yank --vers 0.2.0

# Undo yank if needed
cargo yank --vers 0.2.0 --undo

# Document in changelog
echo "**Note:** Version 0.2.0 was yanked due to [reason]" >> CHANGELOG.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Fails: "Not on main branch"

```bash
# If you're confident, you can continue from another branch
# The script will prompt you to confirm

# Or switch to main first
git checkout main
git pull
make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0
```

### Version Mismatch in CI

If the release PR checks fail with version mismatch:

```bash
# Update version in Cargo.toml manually
vim Cargo.toml

# Regenerate changelog
make changelog VERSION=0.2.0

# Commit and push
git add Cargo.toml CHANGELOG.md
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push -f origin release/0.2.0
```

### Missing Conventional Commits

If commits don't follow conventional format, they won't appear in changelog. Check recent commits and rewrite if needed (before pushing):

```bash
# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -20

# Rewrite commit messages
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

Use conventional format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `perf:` for performance improvements

### Uncommitted Changes

```bash
# Script will prompt to stash
# Or commit/stash manually first
git stash
make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0
git stash pop
```

### Release Branch Already Exists

```bash
# Delete old branch locally and remotely
git branch -D release/0.2.0
git push origin --delete release/0.2.0

# Then run release prepare again
make release-prepare VERSION=0.2.0
```

### CI Checks Failing

```bash
# Run checks locally before pushing
make pre-commit          # Quick checks
make publish-check       # Full pre-publication checks

# Fix issues and amend commit
git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push -f origin release/0.2.0
```

### Changelog Not Generated

```bash
# The Makefile will install git-cliff automatically
make changelog VERSION=0.2.0
```

## Makefile Commands Reference

All release operations use the Makefile:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make release-prepare VERSION=X.Y.Z` | Prepare a new release |
| `make changelog [VERSION=X.Y.Z]` | Generate changelog only |
| `make publish-check` | Run pre-publication checks |
| `make publish-dry-run` | Test package creation |
| `make publish` | Publish to crates.io |

## Best Practices

1. **Use Makefile commands** - Don't call scripts directly
2. **Use conventional commits** - Ensures good changelogs
3. **Test before releasing** - Run `make test`
4. **Review generated changelog** - Check before pushing PR
5. **Tag immediately after merge** - Don't delay tagging
