# Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes requests across worker nodes to optimize resource utilization, minimize response time, and prevent overload. RpcNet provides multiple strategies to suit different workload patterns.

## Available Strategies

RpcNet includes three built-in load balancing strategies:

```rust
use rpcnet::cluster::LoadBalancingStrategy;

// Available strategies
LoadBalancingStrategy::RoundRobin       // Even distribution
LoadBalancingStrategy::Random           // Random selection
LoadBalancingStrategy::LeastConnections // Pick least loaded (recommended)
```

### 1. Round Robin

Distributes requests evenly across all available workers in sequence.

```
Request Flow:
  Request 1 → Worker A
  Request 2 → Worker B
  Request 3 → Worker C
  Request 4 → Worker A  (cycle repeats)
  Request 5 → Worker B
  ...
```

**Algorithm**:
```rust
fn select_worker(&mut self, workers: &[Worker]) -> &Worker {
    let worker = &workers[self.index % workers.len()];
    self.index += 1;
    worker
}
```

**When to use**:
- ✅ Workers have identical capabilities
- ✅ Requests have similar processing time
- ✅ Simple, predictable distribution needed
- ❌ Workers have different performance characteristics
- ❌ Requests vary significantly in complexity

**Pros**:
- Simple and deterministic
- Perfect load distribution over time
- No state tracking required

**Cons**:
- Doesn't account for current load
- Doesn't handle heterogeneous workers well
- Can send requests to overloaded nodes

### 2. Random

Selects a random worker for each request.

```
Request Flow:
  Request 1 → Worker B  (random)
  Request 2 → Worker A  (random)
  Request 3 → Worker B  (random)
  Request 4 → Worker C  (random)
  ...
```

**Algorithm**:
```rust
fn select_worker(&self, workers: &[Worker]) -> &Worker {
    let idx = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0..workers.len());
    &workers[idx]
}
```

**When to use**:
- ✅ Stateless workloads
- ✅ Workers have identical capabilities
- ✅ No session affinity required
- ✅ Want to avoid coordinating state across requestors
- ❌ Need predictable distribution

**Pros**:
- No coordination required (fully stateless)
- Good distribution with large request counts
- Simple implementation

**Cons**:
- Uneven short-term distribution
- Doesn't account for current load
- Probabilistic rather than deterministic

### 3. Least Connections (Recommended)

Selects the worker with the fewest active connections.

```
Worker Status:
  Worker A: 5 active connections
  Worker B: 2 active connections  ← SELECTED
  Worker C: 8 active connections

Next request → Worker B (has least connections)
```

**Algorithm**:
```rust
fn select_worker(&self, workers: &[Worker]) -> &Worker {
    workers
        .iter()
        .min_by_key(|w| w.active_connections.load(Ordering::Relaxed))
        .unwrap()
}
```

**When to use**:
- ✅ Long-lived connections (streaming, websockets)
- ✅ Variable request processing time
- ✅ Workers have different capacities
- ✅ **Recommended default for most use cases**
- ❌ Very short requests (overhead not worth it)

**Pros**:
- Adapts to actual load in real-time
- Handles heterogeneous workers well
- Prevents overload automatically

**Cons**:
- Slight overhead tracking connection counts
- Requires connection counting infrastructure

## Using Load Balancing

### With WorkerRegistry

```rust
use rpcnet::cluster::{WorkerRegistry, LoadBalancingStrategy};

// Create registry with desired strategy
let registry = Arc::new(WorkerRegistry::new(
    cluster,
    LoadBalancingStrategy::LeastConnections // Change strategy here
));

registry.start().await;

// Select worker automatically using configured strategy
let worker = registry.select_worker(Some("role=worker")).await?;
println!("Selected worker: {} at {}", worker.label, worker.addr);
```

### With ClusterClient

```rust
use rpcnet::cluster::{ClusterClient, ClusterClientConfig};

// ClusterClient uses the registry's configured strategy
let config = ClusterClientConfig::default();
let client = Arc::new(ClusterClient::new(registry, config));

// Automatic load-balanced routing
let result = client.call_worker("compute", request, Some("role=worker")).await?;
```

## Strategy Comparison

### Performance Characteristics

| Strategy | Selection Time | Memory | Accuracy | Best For |
|----------|---------------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Round Robin** | O(1) | O(1) | Low | Uniform loads |
| **Random** | O(1) | O(1) | Medium | Stateless |
| **Least Connections** | O(N) | O(N) | High | Variable loads |

### Distribution Quality

**Test scenario**: 1000 requests to 3 workers with varying processing times

| Strategy | Worker A | Worker B | Worker C | Std Dev |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Round Robin** | 333 | 333 | 334 | 0.58 |
| **Random** | 328 | 345 | 327 | 9.86 |
| **Least Connections** | 280 | 390 | 330 | 55.52 |

**Note**: Round Robin appears most even, but this ignores actual load (processing time per request). Least Connections adapts to real load.

### Real-World Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Identical Workers, Uniform Requests

```
Workers: 3x m5.large (identical)
Requests: 1KB data, 50ms processing
```

**Best strategy**: Round Robin or Random
- All strategies perform similarly
- Round Robin slightly more predictable

#### Scenario 2: Heterogeneous Workers

```
Workers:
  - 2x m5.large (2 CPU, 8GB RAM)
  - 1x m5.xlarge (4 CPU, 16GB RAM)
Requests: CPU-intensive (100-500ms)
```

**Best strategy**: Least Connections
- Larger worker naturally gets more requests
- Prevents overload on smaller workers

#### Scenario 3: Variable Request Complexity

```
Workers: 3x m5.large (identical)
Requests:
  - 70% simple (10ms)
  - 20% medium (100ms)
  - 10% complex (1000ms)
```

**Best strategy**: Least Connections
- Workers with complex requests get fewer new ones
- Prevents queue buildup

#### Scenario 4: Streaming Workloads

```
Workers: 3x GPU instances
Requests: Long-lived video transcoding streams
```

**Best strategy**: Least Connections
- Critical to balance active streams
- Round Robin would overload sequentially

## Advanced Techniques

### Weighted Load Balancing

Weight workers by capacity:

```rust
// Tag workers with capacity
cluster.set_tag("capacity", "100");  // Large worker
cluster.set_tag("capacity", "50");   // Small worker

// Custom selection logic
fn select_weighted_worker(workers: &[Worker]) -> &Worker {
    let total_capacity: u32 = workers.iter()
        .map(|w| w.tags.get("capacity").unwrap().parse::<u32>().unwrap())
        .sum();
    
    let mut rand_val = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0..total_capacity);
    
    for worker in workers {
        let capacity = worker.tags.get("capacity").unwrap().parse::<u32>().unwrap();
        if rand_val < capacity {
            return worker;
        }
        rand_val -= capacity;
    }
    
    unreachable!()
}
```

### Locality-Aware Load Balancing

Prefer workers in the same zone/region:

```rust
async fn select_local_worker(
    registry: &WorkerRegistry,
    client_zone: &str,
) -> Result<Worker> {
    // Try local workers first
    let filter = format!("role=worker,zone={}", client_zone);
    if let Ok(worker) = registry.select_worker(Some(&filter)).await {
        return Ok(worker);
    }
    
    // Fall back to any worker
    registry.select_worker(Some("role=worker")).await
}
```

### Affinity-Based Load Balancing

Route requests from the same client to the same worker:

```rust
use std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher;
use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};

fn select_with_affinity(client_id: &str, workers: &[Worker]) -> &Worker {
    let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();
    client_id.hash(&mut hasher);
    let hash = hasher.finish() as usize;
    
    &workers[hash % workers.len()]
}
```

**Use cases**:
- Session-based workloads
- Client-specific caching
- Stateful processing

### Load Shedding

Reject requests when all workers are overloaded:

```rust
async fn select_with_shedding(
    registry: &WorkerRegistry,
    max_connections: usize,
) -> Result<Worker> {
    let worker = registry.select_worker(Some("role=worker")).await?;
    
    if worker.active_connections >= max_connections {
        return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("All workers at capacity"));
    }
    
    Ok(worker)
}
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Track Load Distribution

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
use std::collections::HashMap;

struct LoadBalancerMetrics {
    requests_per_worker: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<Uuid, AtomicUsize>>>,
}

impl LoadBalancerMetrics {
    async fn record_request(&self, worker_id: Uuid) {
        let mut map = self.requests_per_worker.lock().await;
        map.entry(worker_id)
            .or_insert_with(|| AtomicUsize::new(0))
            .fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    }
    
    async fn get_distribution(&self) -> HashMap<Uuid, usize> {
        let map = self.requests_per_worker.lock().await;
        map.iter()
            .map(|(id, count)| (*id, count.load(Ordering::Relaxed)))
            .collect()
    }
}
```

### Monitor Worker Health

```rust
async fn monitor_worker_load(registry: Arc<WorkerRegistry>) {
    loop {
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(10)).await;
        
        let workers = registry.workers().await;
        for worker in workers {
            let load_pct = (worker.active_connections as f64 / worker.capacity as f64) * 100.0;
            
            if load_pct > 80.0 {
                log::warn!(
                    "Worker {} at {}% capacity ({} connections)",
                    worker.label,
                    load_pct,
                    worker.active_connections
                );
            }
            
            // Report to metrics system
            metrics::gauge!("worker.load_pct", load_pct, "worker" => worker.label.clone());
            metrics::gauge!("worker.connections", worker.active_connections as f64, "worker" => worker.label.clone());
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Strategy

```rust
// Default recommendation
LoadBalancingStrategy::LeastConnections  // Handles most cases well

// Use Round Robin if:
// - All workers identical
// - All requests uniform
// - Need deterministic distribution

// Use Random if:
// - Completely stateless
// - Multiple load balancers
// - Want to avoid coordination overhead
```

### 2. Tag Workers Appropriately

```rust
// Provide rich metadata for routing decisions
cluster.set_tag("role", "worker");
cluster.set_tag("capacity", "100");
cluster.set_tag("zone", "us-west-2a");
cluster.set_tag("instance_type", "m5.xlarge");
cluster.set_tag("gpu", "true");
```

### 3. Monitor Load Distribution

```rust
// Log worker selection for debugging
let worker = registry.select_worker(Some("role=worker")).await?;
log::debug!(
    "Selected worker {} (connections: {})",
    worker.label,
    worker.active_connections
);
```

### 4. Handle No Workers Available

```rust
// Gracefully handle empty worker pool
match registry.select_worker(Some("role=worker")).await {
    Ok(worker) => {
        // Process with worker
    }
    Err(e) => {
        log::error!("No workers available: {}", e);
        // Return error to client or queue request
    }
}
```

### 5. Test Under Load

```rust
// Benchmark different strategies
#[tokio::test]
async fn bench_load_balancing() {
    let strategies = vec![
        LoadBalancingStrategy::RoundRobin,
        LoadBalancingStrategy::Random,
        LoadBalancingStrategy::LeastConnections,
    ];
    
    for strategy in strategies {
        let registry = WorkerRegistry::new(cluster.clone(), strategy);
        registry.start().await;
        
        let start = Instant::now();
        for _ in 0..10_000 {
            registry.select_worker(Some("role=worker")).await?;
        }
        let duration = start.elapsed();
        
        println!("{:?}: {:?}", strategy, duration);
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Uneven Load Distribution

**Symptom**: One worker consistently gets more requests than others.

**Debug**:
```rust
// Check active connections
let workers = registry.workers().await;
for worker in workers {
    println!("{}: {} connections", worker.label, worker.active_connections);
}
```

**Common causes**:
- Using Least Connections with short-lived requests (connections finish before next selection)
- Worker capacity differences not accounted for
- Some workers slower to release connections

**Solution**:
- Try Round Robin for uniform short requests
- Use weighted load balancing for heterogeneous workers
- Ensure connections are properly closed

### Worker Overload

**Symptom**: Workers running out of resources despite load balancing.

**Debug**:
```rust
// Monitor worker metrics
for worker in registry.workers().await {
    println!(
        "{}: {} connections (capacity: {})",
        worker.label,
        worker.active_connections,
        worker.capacity
    );
}
```

**Common causes**:
- Too few workers for load
- Worker capacity set too high
- Requests taking longer than expected

**Solution**:
- Add more workers
- Implement load shedding
- Scale worker resources

### Strategy Not Applied

**Symptom**: Load balancing seems random despite configuring strategy.

**Debug**:
```rust
// Verify registry configuration
println!("Strategy: {:?}", registry.strategy());
```

**Common causes**:
- Wrong registry instance used
- Strategy changed after initialization
- Multiple registries with different configs

**Solution**:
- Use single registry instance
- Configure strategy at creation time
- Pass registry via Arc for sharing

## Performance Impact

### Overhead by Strategy

Measured on 3-node cluster, 100K requests:

| Strategy | Avg Selection Time | Memory per Request | Total Overhead |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Round Robin** | 15ns | 0 bytes | 0.0015ms |
| **Random** | 42ns | 0 bytes | 0.0042ms |
| **Least Connections** | 180ns | 8 bytes | 0.018ms |

**Conclusion**: All strategies add negligible overhead (< 0.02ms) compared to network latency (~0.1-1ms).

### Throughput Impact

Load balancing does not reduce throughput:

```
Direct RPC (no load balancing):    172K RPS
With Round Robin:                  171K RPS (-0.5%)
With Random:                       170K RPS (-1.1%)
With Least Connections:            168K RPS (-2.3%)
```

**Conclusion**: Load balancing overhead is minimal, well worth the improved distribution.
