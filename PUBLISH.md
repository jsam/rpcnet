# Publishing RpcNet with Makefile

Quick reference guide for publishing RpcNet to crates.io using Makefile targets.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Update version and docs
vim Cargo.toml CHANGELOG.md README.md

# 2. Commit and tag
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.2.0"
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release version 0.2.0"

# 3. Check everything is ready
make publish-check

# 4. Dry run (see what will be published)
make publish-dry-run

# 5. Publish!
make publish
```

## Makefile Targets

### `make publish-check`

Runs all pre-publication checks to ensure the package is ready:

‚úÖ Tests (all features)  
‚úÖ Code formatting  
‚úÖ Linter (clippy with warnings as errors)  
‚úÖ Documentation build  
‚ö†Ô∏è  Coverage check (warning only)

**When to use**: Before making any publication attempt, or during development to ensure quality.

**Example output**:
```
=== Pre-Publication Checks ===

1. Verifying all tests pass...
‚úÖ All tests passed

2. Checking code formatting...
‚úÖ Code is properly formatted

3. Running linter...
‚úÖ No clippy warnings

4. Building documentation...
‚úÖ Documentation builds successfully

5. Checking coverage...
‚úÖ Coverage 92.3% meets threshold

‚úÖ All pre-publication checks passed!
```

### `make publish-dry-run`

Packages the crate and shows what files will be published:

1. Runs `publish-check` first
2. Lists all files that will be included
3. Creates package in `target/package/`
4. **Does NOT publish** to crates.io

**When to use**: Before actual publication to verify package contents.

**Example output**:
```
=== Packaging rpcnet (library + rpcnet-gen CLI) ===

Reviewing package contents...
Cargo.toml
README.md
LICENSE-MIT
LICENSE-APACHE
src/lib.rs
src/cluster/mod.rs
...

Building package...
‚úÖ Package created successfully!

Package location: target/package/rpcnet-0.2.0.crate

To publish, run: make publish
```

### `make publish`

Publishes to crates.io with safety confirmation:

1. Runs `publish-check` first
2. Asks for confirmation (you must type "yes")
3. Publishes to crates.io
4. Shows next steps after success

**When to use**: When you're ready to publish and have verified everything.

**Example output**:
```
=== Publishing to crates.io ===

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This action cannot be undone!

Are you sure you want to publish rpcnet v0.2.0? (yes/no): yes

Publishing rpcnet crate (library + rpcnet-gen CLI)...
    Uploading rpcnet v0.2.0
‚úÖ Successfully published to crates.io!

Next steps:
  1. Push to GitHub: git push origin main
  2. Push tag: git push origin v0.2.0
  3. Create GitHub release: https://github.com/jsam/rpcnet/releases/new
  4. Verify on crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/rpcnet
  5. Check docs.rs: https://docs.rs/rpcnet
```

## Complete Workflow

### Recommended: Safe and Verified

```bash
# Step 1: Prepare release
vim Cargo.toml          # Update version
vim CHANGELOG.md        # Add release notes
vim README.md           # Update if needed

# Step 2: Commit changes
git add Cargo.toml CHANGELOG.md README.md
git commit -m "chore: prepare v0.2.0 release"
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release version 0.2.0"

# Step 3: Pre-publication checks
make publish-check
# Wait for all checks to pass

# Step 4: Verify package contents (IMPORTANT!)
make publish-dry-run
# Review the file list carefully

# Step 5: Publish
make publish
# Type "yes" when prompted

# Step 6: Push to GitHub
git push origin main
git push origin v0.2.0

# Step 7: Verify publication
# - Visit https://crates.io/crates/rpcnet
# - Test: cargo install rpcnet && rpcnet-gen --help
# - Check https://docs.rs/rpcnet/0.2.0
```

### Quick: For Experienced Publishers

```bash
vim Cargo.toml CHANGELOG.md
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: bump v0.2.0" && git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "v0.2.0"
make publish  # Runs checks automatically
git push origin main && git push origin v0.2.0
```

## What Gets Checked

The `publish-check` target verifies:

### 1. Tests (Critical)
```bash
cargo test --all-features
```
- All 183+ tests must pass
- Tests both library and integration tests
- Includes cluster and streaming tests

### 2. Code Formatting (Critical)
```bash
cargo fmt --check
```
- Code must follow Rust formatting standards
- Run `make format` if this fails

### 3. Linter (Critical)
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```
- No clippy warnings allowed
- Treats warnings as errors
- Ensures code quality

### 4. Documentation (Critical)
```bash
cargo doc --no-deps --all-features
```
- Documentation must build without errors
- Ensures docs.rs will build successfully

### 5. Coverage (Warning Only)
```bash
make coverage-check
```
- Checks for 90%+ coverage
- Only warns if it fails (doesn't block)

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail
```bash
# Run tests to see failures
cargo test --all-features

# Fix the failing tests
vim src/...

# Re-run checks
make publish-check
```

### Formatting Issues
```bash
# Auto-format code
make format

# Or manually
cargo fmt

# Verify
make publish-check
```

### Clippy Warnings
```bash
# See warnings
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# Fix warnings
vim src/...

# Re-check
make publish-check
```

### Documentation Errors
```bash
# Build docs to see errors
cargo doc --all-features

# Fix doc comments
vim src/...

# Verify
make publish-check
```

### Cancel Publication

If you accidentally start `make publish`:

1. **Before typing "yes"**: Just type "no" or press Ctrl+C
2. **After typing "yes"**: Cannot cancel - publish completes immediately
3. **After published**: Cannot delete - can only yank version

## Safety Features

The Makefile publish targets include multiple safety features:

‚úÖ **Automatic checks**: Runs tests, lint, format before publishing  
‚úÖ **Confirmation prompt**: Must type "yes" to proceed  
‚úÖ **Dry run option**: `publish-dry-run` lets you verify first  
‚úÖ **Clear output**: Shows what's happening at each step  
‚úÖ **Next steps**: Reminds you to push tags and create release  
‚ö†Ô∏è **No undo warning**: Clearly states action cannot be undone

## Files Published

When you run `make publish`, these files are included:

**Core Library**:
- `src/**/*.rs` - All source code
- `Cargo.toml` - Package metadata
- `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE` - Licenses

**Documentation**:
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `DEVELOPER.md` - Development guide
- `TESTING.md` - Testing guide

**Examples**:
- `examples/**/*` - All examples including cluster
- `examples/cluster/README.md` - Cluster setup guide

**Tests & Benchmarks**:
- `tests/**/*.rs` - Test suites
- `benches/**/*.rs` - Benchmarks

**Certificates**:
- `certs/test_*.pem` - Test certificates (dev only)

## CLI Tool Included

**Important**: Starting with v0.2.0, the `rpcnet-gen` CLI is included by default!

Users get both:
1. The library (via `Cargo.toml` dependency)
2. The CLI tool (via `cargo install rpcnet`)

No feature flags needed - it just works! üéâ

## Post-Publication

After `make publish` succeeds:

### Immediate (Required)
```bash
git push origin main
git push origin v0.2.0
```

### Create GitHub Release (Required)
1. Go to https://github.com/jsam/rpcnet/releases/new
2. Select tag `v0.2.0`
3. Title: `v0.2.0`
4. Copy release notes from CHANGELOG.md
5. Publish release

### Verify (Recommended)
1. Check crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/rpcnet
2. Wait for docs.rs: https://docs.rs/rpcnet/0.2.0
3. Test installation:
   ```bash
   cargo install rpcnet
   rpcnet-gen --help
   ```

### Announce (Optional)
- Post to Reddit r/rust
- Submit to This Week in Rust
- Tweet/social media
- Blog post
